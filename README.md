- tty-clock (terminal clock which you probably have seen it everywhere)
- waybar (the desktop top bar with bunch of status like battery, clock, network, tray, etc.)
- glow (simple and pretty terminal markdown viewer)
- kitty (hardware accelerated terminal, it's fast!)

## STILL IN DEVELOPMENT


Will make a full comprehensive version soon ( ദ്ദി ˙ᗜ˙ )
